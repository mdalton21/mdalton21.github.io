Hi, I'm Maya (pronounced May-uh)! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State University. 
I also hold an M.A. in Political Science from Penn State University and a B.A. in Politics and International Affairs from Wake Forest University. 
I am a recipient of the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) from the National Science Foundation. 
I have experience with network analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and text analysis. I’m passionate about solving problems which benefit others. 
Previously, I worked as a graduate intern for the National Endowment for the Humanities (2024) and for the United States Government as an Analytical Methodologist (2025). 
My research uses a variety of quantitative techniques to investigate the causes and effects of electoral violence. In my dissertation I examine this topic from three angles: 
(1) civilians and their preferred strategies for electoral contention; 
(2) investigating the network of perpetrators and their targets; and 
(3) probing the relationship between gender quotas and electoral violence.
