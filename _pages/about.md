I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State University. I received my M.A. in Political Science from Penn State University in 2024. Before attending PSU, I received a B.A. in Politics and International Affairs from Wake Forest University in 2022. I am a recipient of the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP) from the National Science Foundation. My research uses a variety of quantitative techniques to investigate the causes and effects of electoral violence. 
In my dissertation I examine this topic from three angles: (1) civilians and their preferred strategies for electoral contention; (2) investigating the network of actors and targets; and (3) probing the relationship between gender quotas and electoral violence.
